Jones, several studies have discovered \\\"positive correlations between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevity.\\\"[215]\\nAn analysis of data from the 1998 US General Social Survey, whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and well-being, also suggested that the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is rather more complicated. The results suggested \\\"that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.[216]\\n\",\n          \"British political theorist Roger Griffin has stated that ultranationalism is essentially founded on xenophobia in a way that finds supposed legitimacy \\\"through deeply mythicized narratives of past cultural or political periods of historical greatness or of old scores to settle against alleged enemies\\\". It can also draw on \\\"vulgarized forms\\\" of different aspects of the natural sciences such as anthropology and genetics, eugenics specifically playing a role, in order \\\"to rationalize ideas of national superiority and destiny, of degeneracy and subhumanness\\\" in Griffin's opinion. Ultranationalists view the modern nation-state as, according to Griffin, a living organism directly akin to a physical person such that it can decay, grow, die, and additionally experience rebirth. He has highlighted Nazi Germany as a regime which was founded on ultranationalism.[3]\\nUltranationalist activism can adopt varying attitudes towards historical traditions within the populace. For instance, the British Union of Fascists inside the United Kingdom adopted a secularist-minded platform centered on perceived technological progress. In contrast, the Iron Guard inside Romania utilized a hardline form of mysticism-driven religion to encourage determination among the nation's ultranationalists. Nonetheless, obsessive views on ethnicity and other divisions as well as connecting politics to motifs of sacrifice generally constitute the psychological framework behind these movements.[3]\\nAccording to American scholar Janusz Bugajski, summing up the doctrine in practical terms, \\\"in its most extreme or developed forms, ultra-nationalism resembles fascism, marked by a xenophobic disdain of other nations, support for authoritarian political arrangements verging on totalitarianism, and a mythical emphasis on the 'organic unity' between a charismatic leader, an organizationally amorphous movement-type party, and the nation\\\". Bugajski believes that civic nationalism and the related concept of patriotism both can contain significantly positive elements, contributing to the common social good at times such as during national calamities. These doctrines stand in contrast, in his opinion, to the extreme approach of certain ideologies with more irrational actions.[8]\\n\",\n          \"Indigenous religions or folk religions refers to a broad category of traditional religions that can be characterised by shamanism, animism and ancestor worship, where traditional means \\\"indigenous, that which is aboriginal or foundational, handed down from generation to generation\\u2026\\\".[160] These are religions that are closely associated with a particular group of people, ethnicity or tribe; they often have no formal creeds or sacred texts.[161] Some faiths are syncretic, fusing diverse religious beliefs and practices.[162]\\nFolk religions are often omitted as a category in surveys even in countries where they are widely practiced, e.g., in China.[161]\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 82,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic_idx\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6,\n          0,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"state, abolished, conquered, disappeared, fell, emperor, jurisdictions, roman, states, superstition\",\n          \"ilkhanate, world, soil, culture, day, art, mongol, christian, dialogue, interfaith\",\n          \"beings, putin, definition, west, 33, control, sacred, dharma, case, women\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
